								to solve this mystery: Let audience vote with their feet.Use the
								carpet capture their feet movements to get emotional feedback.
							</p>
							<p>Balloon Wang analyzed the same data in different stages of
								one live performances,contrast a singer&#8217;s performance at
								different period, compared with the same artists performing in
								different locations, to show us the great value of these data.</p>

							<p>“Come on, i can’t believe there is any relationship with
								rock music and Iteration.”</p>
							<p>“Is there any connection between these things? If there
								is,what is the connection?”</p>
							<p>“Why rock music,what about the classic?”</p>
							<p>Perhaps you will have a similar idea after reading the
								title, but in fact, they can be combined together.</p>
							<p>Xiang YiNing, which was a designers and musician, has
								dished out the &#8220;music is product&#8221; concept for the
								first time in an event organized by Geek Park last year , he
								said:</p>
							<p>“A product is a song, the starting point of one rock song
								is a piece of RIFF, of a product is an idea. Band leader
								equivalent to the CEO, creative soul of a band as product
								manager, lead singer / guitarist as visual designer, bass player
								as interaction designer and drummer as UED / programmer.”</p>
							<p>He put music as Internet products. However, the
								relationship between music and Internet products actually more
								than that, meanwhile,&#8221;iteration&#8221; and music can be
								associated together.</p>
							<p>To those product manager, this is not a new word, and
								&#8220;Quick on-line, rapid iteration&#8221; is one of the basic
								methods of product development.</p>
							<p>
								Associated how?<br /> <a
									href="http://www.sonidigg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1.png"><img
									src="http://www.sonidigg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1.png"
									alt="1" width="640" height="139"
									class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-496" /></a>
							</p>
							<p>Step 1:Find the key points.</p>
							<p>The key to the Internet products’ iteration is to collect
								product data,which is user’s feedback data, then summarize,
								analyze and identify further updated version. Similarly, the key
								to the rock music is also collecting feedback data,
								precisely,which is the audience response.</p>
							<p>But the question is, how to collect data in the music
								scene of the performance? No matter where the band members
								performed ,such as some poor light mini Live House (like the
								Foolish Old Man and MAO Livehouse), some bars, or even in a
								large music festival, it is very difficult to meter audience’
								reaction, because:</p>
							<p>1.The feeling slipped away;</p>
							<p>2.You can’t get the answer by look at a person&#8217;s
								face, maybe this guy is Steven Seagal.</p>
							<p>Geeks Park recently met a bunch of people who claimed that
								they can solve this problem, they call themself Sonidigg. This
								group used a reasonable way to collect data in order to
								determine the audience response.</p>
							<p>Step 2:Get the data right, get the right data.</p>

								Internet Innovation Conference, JooMe installed an router and
								WiFi positioning sensors in the audience’ head which capture the
								audience networked data, after analyzed these data they
								successfully quantify the popularity of a speech.</p>
							<p>
								<a
									href="http://www.sonidigg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2.png"><img

							</p>
							<p>Sonidigg has a similar way to finish this kind of data
								collection, but the focus shifted from the head to the feet, and
								the acquisition devices are also turned into a rug from the
								router, they called it Pedimoni open source carpets.</p>
							<p>The carpet made by Sonidigg’ founder Balloon Wang, he is
								also the lead singer of the band named Churen Huai Yu Wang. As a
								musician, he also encountered the problem mentioned at the
								beginning, &#8220;Came to light after a fight, following a dark,
								watching less than the audience, the sound i heard and the voice
								made by audience is not the same, nobody can determine the
								performance effects. &#8220;So he decided to do something to
								help him out to determine the effect of live performances, the
								band then be arranged according to this thing adjusted.</p>
							<p>In his opinion, you can titillate cheers in a rock show,
								applause can beg, but the audience&#8217;s response was not
								really hidden. For us humans, the most instinctive understanding
								of music begins with one step, it can be said that the audience
								of the &#8220;lower body&#8221; is an important criterion for
								detection of live performances. So Wang and his team put out a
								carpet, which uses piezoelectric ceramic to perceive the
								deformation on the floor, collecting, aggregating, and analyzing
								all the signal, but because the carpet is not easy to deploy, so
								follow the evolution of both the installation or even more
								simple and convenient removal of carpet.</p>

							</p>
							<p>Mao LiveHouse</p>
							<p>The principle is very simple: capture the audience
								stampede strength and frequency and other original data.</p>
							<p>Presentation of data.</p>
							<p>Step 3：:Analysis &#038; Iteration</p>
							<p>
								Comprehensive audience stampede efforts, frequency, temperature,
								and other factors, by the algorithm to quantify the
								audience&#8217;s reaction, side effects come on-site, we can
								draw many valuable conclusions.<br /> <a
									href="http://www.sonidigg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/diedai.png"><img

									alt="diedai" width="630" height="320"
									class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-359" /></a>
							</p>
							<p>By observing these data, we can find out when synchronized
								came out, there is a jump or some fancy Solo, its effect POGO
								gain much more than we expect. They can tell you that which song
								or even what part of this popular glance is really “popular”.
								Bands can check the data reporting, analysis, which tracks
								exactly which part needs to be improved, and thus the formation
								of new rock melodies.</p>
							<p>Say that again please?</p>
							<p>“Speak English!”</p>
							<p>
								OK, i got it, just check this picture out dude.<br /> <a
									href="http://www.sonidigg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/6.png"><img

									alt="6" width="630" height="376"
									class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-500" /></a>
							</p>
							<p>
								Behold, the great Rock &#038; Iteration Figure!<br /> <a
									href="http://www.sonidigg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/7.png"><img
									src="http://www.sonidigg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/7-300x66.png"
									alt="7" width="640" height="141"
									class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-501" /></a>
							</p>
							<p>What else?</p>
							<p>
								Described above is the single band analysis, if we do some
								horizontal contrast, then what kind of results we will get? Yes,
								who is more popular. It is very important for some brands,
								because we can see which bands is the best, we can treat all
								these conclusion as an important reference for future
								investments.<br /> <a
									href="http://www.sonidigg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/8.png"><img

							</p>
							<p>Horizontal contrast four band’ &#8220;Average POGO
								Value&#8221;</p>
							<p>After all, the real data is more reliable than intuition,
								you can not guarantee that you would hear every song in every
								show, but you do can glance through the intuitive information
								map.</p>
							<p>Attack on Internet Thinking</p>
							<p>Although they do not necessarily change the entire music
								industry, but we would be able to see that this is the first
								time Internet thinking attack on the traditional industries of
								the invasion，of course this is not the FIRST invasion target on
								traditional industries, don’t you remember Tesla?</p>
							<p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of so-called smart cars, smart TV,
								they simply put Android system into a car then everything seems
								to be &#8220;smart.&#8221; In fact, they did not understand the
								spirit of the Internet, it’s not like this.</p>
							<p>What we need is change from the inside, it’s thorny,
								isn&#8217;t it?</p>

							<p>Bolloon Wang is a very well-behaved children, at least his
								parents and teachers think so: he goes to collage, picking a
								major and became a graduate student. But nothing could hide his
								clever creations heart. After a series of twists and turns, he
								finally got the recognition of his parents and mentors, embarked
								on the road of entrepreneurship. As a graduate student in BUAA
								he found a company called Sonidigg. There will be what kind of
								story behind a singer who engaged in the hardware?</p>
							<p>He is a good boy and little &#8220;rebellion&#8221;</p>
							<p>Balloon is a very obedient child and also a hard-working
								student, he also obey the guidance of his parents and chose to
								study Electrical Engineering when the university entrance exam
								began. Almost all the course was &#8220;strong
								power&#8221;-related and with nothing in their own interest. But
								because he chose this profession he mastered a lot of
								hardware-related knowledge, and without prejudice to the premise
								of learning he begins &#8220;mischief&#8221;.</p>
							<p>In May 2008, he and his classmates invented the
								&#8220;Internet cafes intelligent safe-box”, in order to
								optimize the user experience of products, he will show it to the
								Internet users and gather their feedback after each update. A
								small amount of production out of the box acclaimed,after that
								they have applied the relevant patent.</p>
							<p>In the ensuing months, they took this project students
								participated in the National Entrepreneurship Competition,
								became the champion and won the 100,000 RMB. Later, he would
								like to use the funds to put this project to market with other
								students. Due to obstruction of the family he can dispel the
								idea of entrepreneurship, complete their studies
								&#8220;obediently&#8221;.</p>
							<p>&#8220;Although I do not like this major, but my
								graduation thesis and project are still relates to it.&#8221;</p>
							<p>After graduation, after comprehensive consideration by his
								family and himself, he chose to go to BUAA for further studies.
								In fact, in his heart he did not care mentor&#8217;s strength at
								all, he hopes to be able to mentor him stocking-style management
								and do interesting things in the lab. Under the guidance of his
								family, he followed a very famous president.</p>
							<p>Music combined with the hardware</p>
							<p>He also has a very wild identity &#8211; the leader to
								Hunan neo-folk music, the stage name of him is
								&#8220;Mr.pregnant.&#8221; Also, he participated in a lot of
								games and get some remarkable results in the past year, for
								example, the band tryouts Midi campus of Hunan Division
								champion. He went to Hunan Economic TV recorded live
								thirty-minute interview in this May then won the recognition of
								his family and mentors. Since then, he was free.</p>
							<p>Then they began to perform in different places. Tech
								background knowledge as he has, naturally, he want to do
								something serious in this field. Through long-term observation,
								he found the audience on an infectious rock songs will make some
								instinctive responses, such as stomping, and even jumping. If
								there is a restless audience carpet extent can be collected, and
								the way the image projected onto the screen, which is not only a
								new type of on-site interaction, better for the music and the
								performer to provide a rational digitized reference standard.</p>
							<p>Although the concept of the product linger in his mind for
								several months, but by the venue and material constraints, he
								can only stay in the thinking stage.</p>
							<p>In last September, Beijing Makerspace was involved an
								installation art exhibition, Balloon build up a carpet on the
								ground according to the circumstances of the screen display to
								bring about interactive effects. After the event, looking at the
								space left by the board he felt that it’s time to take action.
								The audience was intoxicated by the music, the intensity was
								also growing, there were many &#8220;the point of
								explosion&#8221; on the big screen, This live interactive way to
								get a sponsor investors was highly recognized and subsequently
								obtained an secret investor.</p>
							<p>Entrepreneurship made him grow</p>
							<p>Unlike most of the students, Wang now has built a team. He
								get the investment, coupled with Beijing Makerspace incubator
								support, so that he realized the entrepreneurial dream. But in
								the process of entrepreneurship, he gradually discovered some
								new problems.</p>
							<p>Back to the period when he fought alone, he doesn&#8217;t
								need to think more about people, as long as you can concentrate
								on products. With the team he found that the efficiency of the
								players sometimes do not reach their expectations, he need to
								manage.</p>
							<p>&#8220;In fact, I don’t like to control others, but now I
								really have to be &#8216;carrot and stick&#8217; just for the
								team and the project, and I hope that the entire team will get
								more ‘engineers’ feeling, I want to take them towards a better
								future.&#8221;</p>
							<p>By his father&#8217;s influence, he was get used to speak
								straight and doesn&#8217;t need to consider the consequences.
								After suffered several setbacks he had realized what information
								can be external stresses, which must be tight-lipped. A lot of
								things from someone else&#8217;s mouth sounds simple, but when
								he encountered that case, they may be quite different.</p>
							<p>Epilogue</p>
							<p>Lei Feng network organized as we create customer marathon
								day approaching, I asked Balloon that what would create a
								similar product, and his answer was &#8220;Big Mouse
								plan.&#8221; Previously he was seen some people from different
								backgrounds will come out corrupt officials arrested the
								dissemination of information, and a list of appropriate models
								and punish corrupt data. However, most of this information did
								not cause a lot of people&#8217;s attention, he wanted to put
								the data collected through the App up and show the way to better
								interact in front of the mobile phone users. By that time, who
								is &#8220;flies&#8221;, who is the &#8220;Tiger&#8221; at a
								glance.</p>

							<p>December 6, 2012 , a lecture entitled &#8220;If POGO can
								be measured&#8221; began in Beijing MAO livehouse . A few months
								later, carries the dream of rock scene change , Mr.Pregnant,
								founder of the thermometer was preparing for the establishment
								of the POGO thermo . So what exactly is POGO thermometer and
								POGO thermo ? It will give what kind of rock &#038; roll
								ecological impact ? With doubt and curiosity , musicians Raiders
								interviewed noise thermometer founder Mr.Pregnant.</p>
							<p>Q: What is the POGO thermometer ? Can you give an
								introduction of it ?</p>
							<p>A: It’s used to measure the “noise” of POGO .</p>
							<p>POGO as rock a traditional sport has been going on which
								was never been quantified. POGO thermometer laid in rock scene
								through the pressure sensor array will Die Wall, Driving Trains
								, Diving and other traditional style has been on the frequency
								and intensity quantify POGO and let the&#8221; noise up
								&#8220;as the core of the rock scene can be objectively record
								the flow of information to improve the efficiency of rock &#038;
								roll.</p>
							<p>For more detailed description of POGO thermometer , check
								this video below :</p>
							<p>Q：I just think of how to invent this thing.</p>
							<p>A： Good creations are instinctive , either rock or
								technological inventions. As a singer , often came to light
								after a fight, following a dark, watching less than the
								audience, the sound i heard and the voice made by audience is
								not the same, nobody can determine the performance effects.</p>
							<p>Then he start seek feedback hungry and asked fans :
								&#8221; What you think about it?&#8221; fans replied: &#8221;
								Awesome, fantastic, beautiful, remarkable &#038; F kin&#8217;
								Perfect &#8221; nothing more.( of course they sometimes admire
								my &#8221; evil F disk &#8221; sing very evil , and then asked
								that where to buy those pornographic magazine)</p>
							<p>This is absolutely intolerable , which makes each
								rehearsal are not precise planning, I need a closed loop control
								system , so there it is .</p>
							<p>Q: So far, how many live performances that POGO
								thermometer participated in?</p>
							<p>A: The answer is 16 performances , more than three hundred
								songs , including rock &#038; ballads ( conversely data equally
								effective ) ; measured the theme of small-scale performances,
								also measured Escape Plan “metamorphosis” special show.</p>
							<p>What were the band and the audience feedback ? Record
								companies, what kind of repercussions that shows to organizers
								and venue providers?</p>
							<p>At first I told the band when they will actually nervous,
								so the band and its fans with publicly available data must pay
								attention to strategy . Do not put POGO data for horizontal
								comparison with the other band , saying only that the
								longitudinal things : Which song got the highest POGO feedback
								;part of the data belonging to privately communicate with the
								band , we measured the band there is already a part of holding
								data report in rehearsal .</p>
							<p>B2B part it relates to the core secrets of horizontal
								comparison : Which bands best . This is also the most
								interesting content for the performances company , has entered
								into a collaboration with some brands. Now this two-month
								technical upgrade is complete and they has started carry out the
								data services immediately.</p>
							<p>Q: What about the future of POGO thermometer?</p>
							<p>A: Expectations of the future is that we can form an
								industry standard. Now we have a new brand, &#8221; POGO
								thermo&#8221; hoping to help the new brand to do more .</p>
							<p>Q: POGO thermometer, a very special name, how the thought
								of starting such a name at first time?</p>
							<p>1, From the point of view which refers to the scope of
								future upgraded program in the rock scene , there will be a live
								audio and video data recording and visualization interactive
								content , &#8221; thermometer&#8221; can only be used to refer
								to devices , &#8220;POGO thermo &#8221; is more like a set of
								systems .</p>
							<p>2, For the extended meaning, this is the energy measuring
								mechanism that can bristling big ears on the crustal impact
								exercise vigilance. The country&#8217;s major livehouse as a
								fixed seismic source , will be staged every evening by capture
								different magnitude motion, it also can gave a timely warning of
								natural disasters and prevention , it is our responsibility .</p>
							<p>3, For the business positioning meaning, the data itself
								can be a supplier of brand positioning, we do not sell hardware,
								we free shop and everyday we measured then the data is in the
								soil to grow wheat .</p>
							<p>Q: Music is emotional, why use scientific means to
								evaluate the music?</p>
							<p>A: The famous Uncertainty Principle showed that: a certain
								physical quantities of microscopic particles are impossible to
								determine the value of both part, one more the amount determined
								, another quantity , the greater the degree of uncertainty .
								Energy and information comes from rock is a pair of conjugate
								quantity , POGO thermo treat the monitored as the energy , and
								the energy was made by the lower body , upper body
								characterization therefore become blurred, which is why we need
								to hold &#8221; uncertainty &#8221; Music Season , this theme
								the subtext is clear: &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry , we can only use
								our lower body .&#8221;</p>
							<p>Exclusive Secret: POGO thermometer data collected at the
								scene</p>
							<p>In MAO livehouse,the strongest earthquakes occur in the
								Escape Plan New Year&#8217;s Eve concert , through historical
								earthquake records we found , is the historical average of 408%
								.</p>
							<p>The strongest earthquake occurred in the Escape Plan
								singles band singing &#8221; Sad Ten Thousand Times&#8221; when
								the band on the spot than the average magnitude of 117.3% ;
								&#8221; Brightest Star In The Sky &#8221; is actually expected
								to create a strong earthquake , but because of band’s leader
								called on everyone to illuminate the hands of the flash, most of
								the energy is dissipated in the hand , has become the quietest
								audience an earthquake magnitude is 86.3% of the average spot .</p>
							<p>As a warm up band, you often need to work harder to get
								respect , such 16 min, as a warm up band in the Escape Plan’s
								show , the first four songs of the earthquake level of 61.7% of
								Escape Plan , there are people booed scattered applause , later
								guitarist crazy , relying a magnitude of 87.3% in the escape
								plan curtain call song won everyone&#8217;s applause.</p>
							<p>Same front row full of people , AV Okubo earthquake escape
								plan level only 54.2% of its famous song &#8220;love song&#8221;
								earthquake index beyond the scene of some of the songs escape
								plan , but the other songs , the average magnitude only love
								song of 56.7% &#8230;&#8230; so it can be said that we hear such
								a song is to just drive over .</p>
							<p>In contrast, escape plan with every single earthquake
								index is very stable, at an average level of 80% to 120% of
								hovering , his work can be seen strong comprehensive strength .</p>

							<p>Some people are already exploring the power of data in
								realms outside of health. Wang Bolong, the lead singer of punk
								band Bear Warrior, wanted to find a way to measure the audience
								response in order to see how well his band really performed.</p>
							<p>&#8220;If you ask a fan what he or she thinks of the show,
								they only give you vague feedback like &#8216;it was
								good,&#8217; but nothing specific that we could actually use to
								improve ourselves,&#8221; said Wang, whose stage name is
								&#8220;Mr Pregnant.&#8221; The 24-year-old is also a graduate
								student majoring in precision instruments at Beijing University
								of Aeronautics and Astronautics.</p>
							<p>In September he set out to design a device called the
								&#8220;POGO Thermometer,&#8221; which measures the intensity of
								the audience&#8217;s dancing.</p>
							<p>After three months of trial and error, he embedded several
								sensors in a carpet that transmit data on people&#8217;s
								movements to a computer where it is analyzed. The data is then
								transformed into graphs to give a clear visual presentation of
								the audience&#8217;s response.</p>
							<p>Based on his examination of the results from one
								performance, Wang found that fans started moving their bodies
								when the drums kicked in, and they danced the most energetically
								when he sang higher notes.</p>
							<p>Wang believes that such data helps the band improve its
								songwriting, arrangements and performance. He concluded after
								analyzing the data for one of their songs that the chorus was
								too monotonous. The audience seemed bored, and they did not
								respond with much enthusiasm, prompting Wang to consider working
								on the band&#8217;s stage presence.</p>
							<p>Such data tells performers whether they have delivered the
								emotion and meaning they wanted to convey through their music,
								explained Wang. &#8220;The data helps us understand how we can
